# VBM_Rejection_Factors
Identifying Demographic Features Associated with Higher Rates of Mail-in-Ballot Rejection

This repository, used as the capstone project for a data science fellowship at NYC Data Science Academy, analyzes the potential impact of various demographic features on mail-in-ballot rejection rates in NJ. Contributors were Aidan Hughes, Khamanna Iskandarova, and Ariel Perez.

Demographic data was obtained from the Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey estimates. Voter file / ballot data was obtained through Open Public Records Act requests to NJ's Division of Elections -- with the most recent report obtained on 13 Dec 2020. The raw voter / ballot data file is intentionally excluded from our publicly accesible repository for issues of a) size, and b) privacy of voters' contact information contained within the report.

The "final code" folder of the repository includes a pdf copy of the capstone presentation, and the notebooks and CSV files used/generated in the analyses referenced in that presentation. This includes the cleaning and merging of ballot data + demographic data; exploratory data analysis of associated features; and machine learning models used for descriptive and predictive analysis (linear, logistic, and decision tree). Most file names are self-explanatory regarding the components of the project; merged_df.csv includes the dataframe with aggregated VBM statistics by county and demographic data.
